# This file contains the estimated losses on the LSST Camera filter at surface 1 due to condensation of contaminants.
# Values have been taken directly from the spreadsheet LCA-18, V24, 
# tab "Throughput Budget", row 38, col J-O.
#
# Placeholder values here correspond to increasing outer layer thicknesses (H2O) by 2nm (theoretical) 
# and 3nm (specification) over conditions at which filters were calibrated at the vendor. We compute a 
# degradation of 0.05% per nm of H2O on one side of the multilayer filter. (A. Rasmussen, SLAC)
