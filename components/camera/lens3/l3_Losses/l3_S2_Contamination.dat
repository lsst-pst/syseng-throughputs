# This file contains the estimated losses on the LSST Camera lens 3 at surface 2 due to  contaminants.
# Values have been taken directly from the spreadsheet LCA-18, V24,
# tab "Throughput Budget", row 32, col J-O.

#
# Specificaton & expected performance cases based on surface cleanliness level 500 according to 
# Tribble's modified MIL-STD-1246C; no further degradation assumed (A. Rasmussen, SLAC).  Degradation
# from factory acceptance test to when the lens/filter is at SLAC under envionmental control is included 
# in the base losses for contamination).
