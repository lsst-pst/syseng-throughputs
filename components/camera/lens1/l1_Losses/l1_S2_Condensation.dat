# This file contains the estimated losses on the LSST Camera lens 1 at surface 2 due to condensation of contaminants.
# Values have been taken directly from the spreadsheet LCA-18,  V24, 
# tab "Throughput Budget", row 19, col J-O.
#
# Values here correspond to increasing outer layer thicknesses (H2O) by 30nm (theoretical) and 45nm (specification)
# over conditions at which elements were calibrated at the vendor. We compute a degradation of 0.0085% per nm of
# H2O per surface on a quarter wave AR coating.  These degradations are smaller by a factor of 6 than for multilayer
# AR coatings. (A. Rasmussen, SLAC)
