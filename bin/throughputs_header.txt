## Baseline throughput curves.  ##

The throughput curves in this directory should be considered
'baseline' for the current modeled behavior of Rubin. An X=1.2 atmosphere
has been used to compile the 'total' throughputs and average losses over time
have been included.

Note that these throughput curves are subject to change as our knowledge
of the Rubin systems improve.

m1.dat, m2.dat, m3.dat represent the current mirror throughputs
lens1.dat, lens2.dat, lens3.dat represent the current lens throughputs
detector.dat is the current detector sensitivity

filter_u / g / r / i / z / y. dat represent the current filter (filter only!) throughput curves.

atmos_std.dat is a fiducial atmosphere throughput at Rubin at 1.2 airmasses.

total_*.dat throughput curves represent the combination of all components in the Rubin
system - mirrors, lenses, filter, detector, and the zenith atmos_std.dat atmosphere.

(hardware_*.dat curves are the hardware only, without atmospheric component).

All curves are in nanometers, with throughput represented by a number between 0 and 1.
